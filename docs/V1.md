After investigating pnpm, we can maybe rewrite fiks to be simpler:

We need to maintain symbolic links to all local packages
* When we push a new version of a github package, we need to update the package-lock.json of all local repos that use it
* If the package is an npm package, we need to to npm-check-updates
* If the package is a github package, we need to do npm update
* Cancel if we need to pull
* Cancel if there are changes

This is the absolute basics. Maybe turn off everything else right now?

For running things in root, we can run git commands with `git -C admin status`` and npm commands with --prefix: `npm --prefix admin install waveorb`

We probably just need a fiks update command. Instead of automatically updating everything on fix push, we can run fiks update to have all package-lock.json files updated. This should probably be interactive, one by one, and transactional, meaning we can cancel if something isn't right.

The interactive script can also ask what you want to do if there are local or remote changes:

* If there are local changes we can stash, clean or commit first
* If we stashed, we can stash apply after we're done
* If we clean, we run git reset --hard + git clean -df
* If we commit, we ask for commit message and push, verify with git status

Make it look like the node tests:

✔ - green
✖ - red
